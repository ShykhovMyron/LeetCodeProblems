/**
 * 16. 3Sum Closest
 * <p>
 * Medium
 * <p>
 * <p>
 * <p>
 * Given an integer array nums of length n and an integer target, find three integers in nums such that the sum is closest to target.
 * <p>
 * Return the sum of the three integers.
 * <p>
 * You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution.
 * <p>
 * <p>
 * <p>
 * Example 1:
 * <p>
 * Input: nums = [-1,2,1,-4], target = 1
 * Output: 2
 * Explanation: The sum that is closest to the target is 2. (-1 + 2 + 1 = 2).
 * Example 2:
 * <p>
 * Input: nums = [0,0,0], target = 1
 * Output: 0
 * <p>
 * <p>
 * Constraints:
 * <p>
 * 3 <= nums.length <= 1000
 * -1000 <= nums[i] <= 1000
 * -104 <= target <= 104
